# Setting Up a Vagrant Environment with Nix

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your host machine:
- Vagrant
- VirtualBox or another supported Vagrant provider.

## Steps

1. **Create a New Vagrant Project Directory:**
    Open your terminal and create a new directory for your Vagrant project.
    ```bash
    mkdir nix-vagrant
    cd nix-vagrant
    ```

2. **Initialize a Vagrant Environment:**
    Run the following command to initialize a new Vagrant environment in your project directory.
    ```bash
    vagrant init
    ```

3. **Edit the Vagrantfile:**
    Open the Vagrantfile in a text editor and configure it to create a VM with your desired settings. In this example, we're using the "bento/ubuntu-20.04" box and allocating 2GB of RAM to the VM. The Vagrant shell provisioner is used to install Nix using the Nix installation script.

4. **Start the VM:**
    In your project directory, run the following command to start the VM.
    ```bash
    vagrant up
    ```
    Vagrant will download the base box if you haven't already and create a VM based on your configuration.

5. **SSH into the VM:**
    After the VM is up and running, you can SSH into it to work with Nix.
    ```bash
    vagrant ssh
    ```

6. **Verify Nix Installation:**
    Once you're inside the VM, you can verify that Nix is installed by running the following command.
    ```bash
    nix --version
    ```
    This should display the Nix package manager version.
