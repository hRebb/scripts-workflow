# Installing Nix on Gitpod

## Steps

1. **Create a Gitpod Workspace:**
    Start by creating a Gitpod workspace for your project or a new one. If you're using an existing repository, you can open it in Gitpod by prefixing the GitHub URL with `https://gitpod.io/#`.

2. **Create a .gitpod.Dockerfile (Optional):**
    If you want to create a custom Docker image for your Gitpod workspace, you can create a `.gitpod.Dockerfile` in the root of your project. You find an example on the `Dockerfile` present in the folder
    This is a minimal example; you can add more customizations as needed. Refer to the Gitpod documentation for more details.

3. **Configure the .gitpod.yml File:**
    Create or modify the `.gitpod.yml` file in the root of your project to specify the Docker image to use and additional setup steps. Here's an example on `.simply_docker-gitpod.yml`
    This configuration sets up a task to install Nix and then opens a Nix shell. Customize the installation steps and Nix packages according to your project requirements.

4. **Commit and Push Your Changes:**
    Commit the `.gitpod.Dockerfile` and `.gitpod.yml` files to your repository and push them to your Git repository.

5. **Open Your Workspace:**
    Open your Gitpod workspace by prefixing the GitHub URL with `https://gitpod.io/#`. Gitpod will automatically build the Docker image and set up your development environment, including Nix.

6. **Use Nix:**
    You can now use Nix in your Gitpod workspace as needed. You can use Nix commands like `nix-shell` to manage your project's development environment.

When setting up Nix in a Gitpod workspace, you may need to create a nix configuration file to define the dependencies and build steps for your project. This configuration file is typically named `default.nix`. The exact content of the `default.nix` file will depend on your project's needs, but here's a basic example to get you started.

The file defines a Nix derivation using `stdenv.mkDerivation`. This derivation represents your project's development environment.

- `name` specifies a name for the Nix environment. You can change this to match your project's name.
- `buildInputs` is a list of Nix packages that your project depends on. You should list the dependencies your project needs to build and run correctly.
- `shellHook` allows you to specify additional setup steps that should be performed when entering the Nix shell. This can be helpful for setting environment variables or running custom initialization scripts.

You should customize the `default.nix` file to match the specific requirements of your project. Add your project's dependencies to the `buildInputs` list, and include any necessary setup steps in the `shellHook`.

Once you have created or modified your `default.nix` file, you can use Nix commands like `nix-shell` to enter the Nix shell environment. For example, if your `default.nix` is in the root directory of your project, you can run:

```bash
nix-shell
```

This will activate the Nix shell environment, ensuring that all project dependencies are available, and any custom setup steps defined in your `default.nix` are executed.
